## 🚀 How Can I Utilize This?
If you have a **HackRF** with **Portapack**, you'll find a feature called **Soundbrd** in the **Transmit** section. This tool allows you to broadcast **.wav** files, but please note that it does not support standard **.wav** or **.mp3** files. With this program, you can convert **.mp3** files into the suitable **.wav** format required for transmission.

-----

## 📦 How to Install?
You can choose one of the following installation methods:

1. **Python Method**: 
   - Install Python on your system.
   - Enter the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to begin the installation of `PyQt5`.
   - Run the `HackRF WAV Creator.py` file from the repository.
   - Ensure that the `ffmpeg.exe` file is in the same folder as the script (*extracted from the `ffmpeg.rar` archive*). 

2. **Executable Method**:
   - Download the precompiled **.exe** file from the **Releases** section. (*This method does not require the `ffmpeg.exe` to be in the same folder*)

### The converted .wav file will be created in the same folder as the original .mp3 file.
